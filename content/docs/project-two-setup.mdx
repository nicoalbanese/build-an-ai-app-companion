Welcome! In this section, we'll be exploring the fundamentals of AI SDK Core by building a few terminal programs.

We'll be seeing how good of a comedian GPT can be! 

Let's start by setting up our project.

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the following repository locally


```bash 
git clone https://github.com/nicoalbanese/ai-sdk-core-starter.git
cd ai-sdk-core-starter
```
</Step>
<Step>
Install packages using your preferred package manager

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm']} persist>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step>
Copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
</Step>
<Step>
Add your OpenAI API Key to your `.env` file
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-**********************
```
</Step>
<Step>
Run the following command in your terminal.
```bash
pnpm tsx src/index.ts
```
You should see your OpenAI API Key outputted to the terminal.
</Step>
</Steps>
Great! You are now ready to go!
